## LZ77
![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/whoughton/lz77.svg?branch=master)

A TypeScript/ESM implementation of LZ77, usable for Node.js and modern browsers.

### What is LZ77
LZ77 and LZ78 are the two lossless data compression algorithms published in papers by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1977 and 1978. They are also known as LZ1 and LZ2 respectively. These two algorithms form the basis for many variations including LZW, LZSS, LZMA and others. Besides their academic influence, these algorithms formed the basis of several ubiquitous compression schemes, including GIF and the DEFLATE algorithm used in PNG.

They are both theoretically dictionary coders. LZ77 maintains a sliding window during compression. This was later shown to be equivalent to the explicit dictionary constructed by LZ78â€”however, they are only equivalent when the entire data is intended to be decompressed. LZ78 decompression allows random access to the input as long as the entire dictionary is available, while LZ77 decompression must always start at the beginning of the input

#### ESM/TypeScript Example

```ts
import { compress, decompress } from 'lz77';

const original: string = 'your string here';
const compressed: string | false = compress(original);
const decompressed: string | false = decompress(compressed as string);

console.log(decompressed); // should equal original
```

#### API
- `compress(source: string, params?: Partial<LZ77Settings>): string | false`
- `decompress(source: string, params?: Partial<LZ77Settings>): string | false`

#### TypeScript Support
- This library is written in TypeScript and ships with type definitions.
- You can use it seamlessly in both TypeScript and modern JavaScript projects.

* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78)

### Usage

```js
import { compress, decompress } from 'lz77';

const original = 'your string here';
const compressed = compress(original);
const decompressed = decompress(compressed);

console.log(decompressed); // should equal original
```

### API Documentation

You can generate and view the latest API documentation using [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/):

```sh
npm run docs
```

This will generate HTML documentation in the `docs/` directory. Open `docs/index.html` in your browser to view the API docs for all exported functions and types.

> **Note:** This implementation is lossless and round-trip safe: `decompress(compress(input)) === input` for all valid input. However, the exact compressed output may differ from previous versions or other LZ77 implementations, as there are multiple valid ways to encode the same data.

### Browser Usage

You can use this library directly in the browser after bundling with Vite:

#### 1. Build the browser bundles

```sh
npm run build:bundle
```
This will create:
- `dist/lz77.es.js` (ESM, for modern browsers/imports)
- `dist/lz77.umd.js` (UMD, for legacy browsers or global usage)

#### 2. Usage in HTML

**Modern browsers (ESM):**
```html
<script type="module">
  import { compress, decompress } from './dist/lz77.es.js';
  const compressed = compress('hello world');
  const decompressed = decompress(compressed);
  console.log(decompressed);
</script>
```

**Legacy/global usage (UMD):**
```html
<script src="./dist/lz77.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  // window.LZ77 is available
  const compressed = LZ77.compress('hello world');
  const decompressed = LZ77.decompress(compressed);
  console.log(decompressed);
</script>
```
